# Micah Walker — Design Portfolio

A personal portfolio showcasing product design work with a focus on clarity, motion, and grounded user experiences.

## 🌍 Design Philosophy

### Earth / Motion / Clarity

This portfolio embodies a design language rooted in natural elements and intentional movement. Every interaction is crafted to feel organic and purposeful—from the gentle glow that follows your cursor to the smooth transitions between content sections.

### Theme System

Two distinct themes reflect different facets of the natural world:

- **Sage** — Calm, grounded greens inspired by forest canopies and morning light
- **Clay** — Warm terracotta tones evoking earth, craft, and tactile materials

Both themes support light and dark modes, adapting to the viewer's environment while maintaining visual harmony.

## ✨ Experience

The portfolio presents design work through thoughtful organization:

- **Experience Timeline** — Professional history displayed in an expandable accordion format, allowing visitors to explore roles and responsibilities at their own pace
- **Portfolio Grid** — Case studies organized by phase (Research, Proof of Work, Final Design, Reflection), demonstrating the full design process
- **Multilingual Support** — Content available in English and Spanish to reach a broader audience

## 🎨 Visual Language

### Motion & Interaction

Subtle animations reinforce hierarchy and guide attention:
- Hover states create a warm glow effect, drawing focus to interactive elements
- Smooth transitions between sections maintain spatial awareness
- Micro-interactions provide feedback without distraction

### Accessibility

Design decisions prioritize inclusivity:
- High contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA standards
- Keyboard navigation with visible focus states
- Reduced motion support for users who prefer minimal animation
- Semantic structure for screen reader compatibility

## 🎮 Easter Egg

A playful paper toss game rewards curious visitors—a nod to the joy of discovery and the importance of delight in design.
